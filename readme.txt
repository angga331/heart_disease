Academic based, preprocessing and training model for heart disease classification.

Using KSVNN algorithm, K-Support Vector Nearest Neighbor, which is a custom algorithm based on academic journals, making better results in evaluation rather than original KNN. Instead of using original neighbor calculation, here we filtered it more into support vectors, same references to SVV algorithm.
